### Project Overview
This project focuses on efficiently integrating diverse research data into the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, enhancing data exchange between research and clinical systems, and ultimately contributing to researcher productivity.

### Objectives
1. **Data Mapping and Transformation:** Develop algorithms for mapping research data types to FHIR resources.
2. **Gen3 Implementation:** Implement FHIR-based APIs and structures for integration into ACED-IDP server.
3. **Semantic Interoperability:** Establish semantic interoperability for pragmatic data exchange with other research studies.
4. **Security, Privacy, Scalability, and Performance:** Implement security measures, ensure privacy compliance, and optimize the system for scalability and performance to handle large volumes of research data securely.


### Expected Outcomes
1. Efficient integration of diverse research data into the FHIR standard.
2. Enhanced data accessibility for healthcare professionals and researchers.
3. Accelerated translational research and evidence-based healthcare.
